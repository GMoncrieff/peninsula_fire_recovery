# Cape Peninsula Fire Recovery  
### Code and data from Slingsby, Moncrieff and Wilson "Near-real time change detection for an open ecosystem with complex natural dynamics"  

To run this code you will need to have R, Rstudio and [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) installed 
  
Clone this repo:  
`git clone https://github.com/GMoncrieff/peninsula_fire_recovery.git`  
Install the required packages using renv:  
`renv::init()` 

In addition you will need to have [jags](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/) installed to fit models using MCMC. Model fitting is computationally intensive, requiring +/- 24 hours on a machine with a minimum of 4 cores and 64GB RAM

To run the EarthEngine code you will need to have an Earth Engine account. You can sign up for a free account [here](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/). The app is running online [here](https://glennwithtwons.users.earthengine.app/view/peninsula-fire-recovery)
